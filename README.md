A Small Webservice That Scrobbles Spotify Connect Plays

# Setup

The best way to run this scrobbler is with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io).
Assuming you have already virtualenv and Python 3.6 installed, create a new environment

  ```bash
  virtualenv <path to env> --python=python3.6
  ```

Activate the environment and install the scrobbler from git:

  ```bash
  cd <path to env>
  source bin/activate
  pip install git+https://github.com/jeschkies/spotify-connect-scrobbler.git
  ```

Verify that the scrobbler is avialable:

  ```bash
  scrobbler --help
  ```

The scrobbler requires access tokens to the Spotify web API and Last.fm API.
You authenticate your accounts with

  ```
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<Your app ID> \
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your app secret> \
  LASTFM_API_KEY=<Your app key> \
  LASTFM_API_SECRET=<Your app secret> \
  scrobbler-auth <path to credentials file>
  ```

After you've followed the instructions the access tokens are saved to the
credentials file you've specified. This file is required by the scrobbler.
